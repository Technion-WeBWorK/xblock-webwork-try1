This was originally a private fork of https://github.com/ofekcensor/xblock-webwork and when that became public the connection was lost.
As a result, a new fork was created at https://github.com/Technion-WeBWorK/xblock-webwork and the new code was merged into there.
This repository retains the GitHub history of the private fork.
All future work should use only the new https://github.com/Technion-WeBWorK/xblock-webwork.

WeBWorK-PG XBlock
=================
An edX XBlock that uses WeBWorK's PG as its backend.
LMS functionality usually handled by WeBWorK's webwork2 LMS code will be handled inside the XBlock.
A "thin" web service based on WeBWorK's XMLRPC code will provide the API with which the XBlock communicates.
